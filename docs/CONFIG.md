# Configuration Reference — New Config Surface

Pi-blackhole's configuration lives at `~/.pi/agent/pi-blackhole/pi-blackhole-config.json`. This document describes the new unified config keys introduced by the config simplification.

## Config file safety

The config file must contain **valid JSON**. A trailing comma, partial write, or sync-conflict copy will cause the entire file to be rejected — the loader reports the failure instead of silently replacing your config with defaults.

**Current behavior:**
- Invalid JSON is surfaced as a yellow TUI warning — `Config file "pi-blackhole-config.json" is Invalid JSON: <parse error>. Using defaults.`
- `/blackhole settings` (alias `/blackhole configure`) still opens and shows defaults for the unreadable file — the modal does not block on the parse error
- Saves are diff-based against the file: only fields you actually changed are written, and unknown keys outside the schema (hand-edited extras) are preserved
- Changes take effect **immediately** — no session restart needed (the runtime reloads config from disk after save)

**If your config gets corrupted:** fix the JSON syntax directly in the file *before* saving from the modal. An unreadable file reads back as empty, so a `global`/`project` save has nothing to diff against and rewrites the file with exactly what the modal is showing (defaults, plus any env overrides) — everything the broken file held is gone. A `session`-scope save writes the session JSONL instead and leaves the file untouched.

## Compaction Section

### `compaction`

Controls when compaction triggers. Replaces the old `noAutoCompact` and partially replaces `passive`.

| Value | Auto-trigger | `/compact` (Pi built-in) | `/blackhole` |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `"auto"` | blackhole fires at the auto-compaction threshold ✓ | blackhole handles | blackhole handles |
| `"manual"` | skipped | Pi handles ✓ | blackhole handles |
| `"off"` | skipped (Pi handles) | Pi handles ✓ | blackhole handles |

**Examples:**

```jsonc
// Auto-compact (default)
{ "compaction": "auto" }

// Manual only — /compact falls through to Pi, /blackhole uses blackhole pipeline
{ "compaction": "manual" }

// Blackhole skips auto + /compact (Pi handles both), /blackhole still works
{ "compaction": "off" }
```

### `compactionEngine`

Controls which engine generates compaction summaries. Only meaningful when `compaction: "auto"` — for `"manual"`/`"off"` the engine is irrelevant because blackhole's hook lets Pi handle everything except `/blackhole`.

Replaces the old `overrideDefaultCompaction`.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"blackhole"` | Blackhole's `compile()` generates a structured summary and injects OM content (default). |
| `"pi-default"` | Pi handles ALL compaction (timing + execution). Blackhole's trigger skips entirely. Blackhole only activates for `/blackhole` command. |

**Interaction matrix:**

| `compaction` | `compactionEngine` | Auto-trigger | `/compact` | `/blackhole` |
|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| auto | blackhole | blackhole fires at the auto-compaction threshold ✓ | blackhole handles | blackhole handles |
| auto | pi-default | trigger skips (Pi decides when) | Pi handles | blackhole handles |
| manual | (any) | skipped | Pi handles ✓ | blackhole handles |
| off | (any) | skipped | Pi handles ✓ | blackhole handles |

### `tailBehavior`

Controls how much of the recent transcript stays *visible* after compaction. Only applies when `compactionEngine: "blackhole"`.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"pi-default"` | Use Pi's `firstKeptEntryId` — respects Pi's `keepRecentTokens` (~20k tokens kept). Messages before Pi's cut are compiled into the summary and removed from view. |
| `"minimal"` | Keep only the last user message, unless Pi provides a later safe split-turn boundary for an oversized current turn. Everything before the chosen boundary gets compiled and removed (default for both auto-triggered and manual `/blackhole`). |

**Visual comparison:**

```
pi-default (Pi's cut at m3):
  Branch:  [m1] [m2] [m3] [m4] [m5] [m6]
            ──compiled──  ─────visible─────
                          (Pi's keepRecentTokens)

minimal (last user at m5):
  Branch:  [m1] [m2] [m3] [m4] [m5] [m6]
            ─────compiled──────  ─visible─
                                 (last user only)
```

**Effective behavior (how the hook resolves it):**

| Invocation | `tailBehavior` config | Effective |
|------------|:--------------------:|:---------:|
| Manual `/blackhole` | not set | `"minimal"` (aggressive) |
| Manual `/blackhole` | `"pi-default"` | `"pi-default"` |
| Auto-triggered | not set | `"minimal"` (aggressive) |
| Auto-triggered | `"minimal"` | `"minimal"` |

**Examples:**

```jsonc
// Always use aggressive cut (both auto and manual — default)
{ "tailBehavior": "minimal" }

// Use Pi's gentler cut for both auto and manual
{ "tailBehavior": "pi-default" }
```

### `showPreCompactionMessage`

Default `true`. After a successful Blackhole compaction, append a display-only copy of the **newest assistant output that the cut removed from view** so the terminal keeps showing the answer you were reading.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | Copy up to 16 KiB of the newest dropped assistant text into a plain `blackhole-pre-compaction-output` session entry, rendered as `[Previous output — display only]` below the retained tail and above the compaction card. |
| `false` | No copy; the compaction card appears alone (pre-0.5.x behavior). |

The copy is **cosmetic**: Pi renders the entry but never sends it to the model (`sessionEntryToContextMessages` returns nothing for plain `custom` entries), and Blackhole's own serializers only read `message`, `custom_message`, and `branch_summary` entries. It does not change `firstKeptEntryId`, the summary, or the auto-compaction threshold.

When the newest dropped message is already retained by the cut (the common `minimal` case, where the last user turn and everything after it stay visible), nothing is copied — no duplicates. Compact-all with no retained tail copies the final answer instead.

Things that stay out of the copy: tool output, thinking blocks, images, and exact card layout. The copy is truncated at 16 KiB with a `[Copy truncated]` marker; each eligible compaction adds one entry to the session file (a bounded disk and redraw cost, not a token cost).

```jsonc
// Default: keep the newest dropped answer visible
{ "showPreCompactionMessage": true }

// Plain compaction card only
{ "showPreCompactionMessage": false }
```

### `midRunCompaction`

Controls the **mid-run** auto-compaction trigger. Pi's `agent_end` event only fires when a run exits — during long tool loops (agent calling tools turn after turn) the threshold would otherwise never be evaluated, and accumulated tokens could blow far past the auto-compaction threshold before compaction had any chance to run. This trigger evaluates the threshold at every `turn_end` (after each assistant message + tool executions) while the agent is still working.

Only applies when `compaction: "auto"` and `compactionEngine: "blackhole"`.

Full mechanism, history, and debugging guide: [mid-run-compaction.md](mid-run-compaction.md).

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"resume"` *(experimental)* | Compact transparently at an awaited `turn_end`, then continue inside the **same** agent run and outer `session.prompt()` promise. No run abort and no synthetic continuation message. |
| `"pause"` | Use Pi's native interrupting `ctx.compact()` at the threshold, then stop. The user continues manually. |
| `"off"` | No mid-run evaluation; only check the threshold when the agent finishes a run (default). Non-persisted sessions (see below) always use the inline path instead. |

`"resume"` reuses Pi's native summary, `session_before_compact`, session-entry, and context-rebuild pipeline. Blackhole's runtime adapter suppresses only the compaction method's initial internal quiesce (`abort`, plus disconnect on older Pi), then refreshes the low-level loop from the compacted `agent.state.messages` before another provider request. Completed tools stay paired, the active run signal is not aborted, background agents do not receive a false interrupt, and nested runners keep awaiting their original prompt promise.

**Compatibility is fail-closed.** The adapter recognizes the known Pi 0.81 legacy and Pi 0.84 connected-listener compact shapes. If Pi internals drift, `"resume"` refuses the mid-run attempt, leaves the current run alive, reports the incompatibility, and suspends retries at that pressure level. It never falls back to the old abort + `blackhole-resume` path.

`"pause"` is intentionally different: it calls public `ctx.compact()`, which aborts the active run by design. That abort may propagate to extensions which treat the run signal as user cancellation, so use `"resume"` for transparent/subagent workflows.

**Non-persisted sessions (subagents, SDK/flow runners).** In-memory sessions (`SessionManager.inMemory()`) are typically disposed by their parent right after `agent_end`, so the deferred `agent_end` compaction reliably loses that race and bails on a stale extension ctx ([#92](https://github.com/k0valik/pi-blackhole/issues/92)); and `"pause"`'s run-interrupting `ctx.compact()` has no user to hand control back to. Non-persisted sessions therefore resolve **all three** `midRunCompaction` values to the transparent inline path at `turn_end` — same-run continuation, no abort, runner lifecycle untouched. Persisted sessions (TUI, file-backed) keep the configured semantics exactly. Fail-closed: when the inline adapter is unsupported for the host, non-persisted sessions skip mid-run compaction entirely — surfaced once per process via the `agent_start` warning; per-turn skips are debug-logged only (they are not counted, since the skip fires every turn while over threshold and would inflate a counter denominated in scheduled compactions). Separate visibility: every *scheduled* auto-compaction skipped because the ctx went stale is counted (`Skipped compactions (disposed ctx): N` in `/blackhole-memory` status, process-wide so a parent surfaces nested-session skips) and warned once per session (UI notification, or stderr for headless runs). Adapter-unavailable warnings are UI-only by design — headless sessions get no `console.warn` (it would leak into the subagent transcript) and the parent cannot be reached without knowing the subagent host, so headless operators watch `debug.ndjson` instead. The `agent_end` deferral remains as a backstop for persisted sessions and for pressure that only crosses the threshold on a run's final turn; non-persisted sessions with an unsupported adapter skip the settled path too (fail-closed).

**Re-trigger safety:** after a successful compaction, accumulated tokens are counted from the fresh compaction entry. Failed or cancelled attempts are suspended until pressure drops below the threshold.

```jsonc
// Default: only evaluate when the run ends
{ "midRunCompaction": "off" }

// Opt in to transparent same-run compaction during long tool loops
{ "midRunCompaction": "resume" }

// Interrupt the run, compact, and hand control back to the user
{ "midRunCompaction": "pause" }
```

### `compactAfterTokens`

Explicit fixed token threshold for auto-compaction. Optional — unset (or `0`) by default. When set to any value other than the reserved legacy `81000` (see below), it **always wins** over `compactAfterRatio`, `compactReserveTokens`, and the selected preset curve. When `compaction: "auto"` and the measured context since the last compaction reaches the effective threshold, compaction triggers automatically — both mid-run (see `midRunCompaction`) and when the agent finishes a run. If the engine is `pi-default`, blackhole's trigger returns early before checking tokens.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | unset (`0` = not set) |

**Legacy `81000` residue (migration):** Configs scaffolded by earlier versions, or written by the settings modal before the preset-curve release, literally contain `"compactAfterTokens": 81000` — the old fixed default posture, never a deliberate user pin. The loader treats exactly `81000` as that residue and drops it, so the selected preset curve (or a window-derived knob) governs. The drop does **not** apply to a value set via the `PI_BLACKHOLE_COMPACT_AFTER_TOKENS` env var — env overrides are always explicit. To pin a fixed threshold, set any *other* value (e.g. `80000` or `180000`); the flat-81k behavior can no longer be reproduced by writing exactly `81000`.

**The interaction with Pi's threshold:** Pi has its own `keepRecentTokens` default (~20k tokens). Blackhole's threshold is independent — it's the trigger point, not the keep point. When blackhole's trigger fires, `tailBehavior` determines how much is actually kept visible.

### `retainedToolOutputMaxTokens`

Set to `0` to disable the budget entirely (opt-out). By default a 20000-token budget is applied.

Dedicated token budget for historical `toolResult` text and shell output retained by a Blackhole compaction. At the compaction boundary, Blackhole scans the retained tail newest-first, retaining each full text output while it fits. The text crossing the budget and all older text outputs are represented by compact markers that point to `recall #N` when a stable transcript index is available. That representation is persisted with the compaction and stays unchanged during ordinary provider calls until the next Blackhole compaction. Non-text parts such as images are preserved and do not count against this budget.

This only changes the retained context sent to the provider. Session JSONL, compaction summaries' source messages, and recall data remain full fidelity. Trailing results that have not yet been consumed by an assistant response are protected even when they exceed the budget; they can become eligible when a later compaction constructs a new retained representation.

| Type | Default | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| number | 20000 | `0` (disabled) or positive integer |

### `recallResponseMaxChars`

Set to `0` to disable the budget entirely (opt-out). Default 48000 characters (~12k tokens).

Bounding cap on any single `recall` tool / `/blackhole-recall` response. A huge stored message (long tool-result line, big expanded entry, giant observation body) must never flood the agent's context. Per-entry and per-line allocations are derived internally from this one knob:

- Search snippet lines capped (~1000 chars) with the match kept visible.
- Expanded entries share the budget, each with a continuation marker to `#N:text:full` / `#N:path:full`.
- Related observation/reflection bodies capped (~1200 chars); full content reachable via the 12-hex memory id.
- Total budget enforced entry-aware (trailing entries dropped before the header, footer names the omitted count + continuation).

Session JSONL and the complete stored content are never modified — only what a single recall response renders is bounded, and the full payload stays reachable via paged drill-downs (`#N:text:offset:limit` / `#N:path:offset:limit`).

| Type | Default | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| number | 48000 | `0` (unbounded) or positive integer |

### `compactAfterRatio` *(context-window-aware threshold, opt-in)*

Instead of a fixed token count, derive the auto-compaction threshold from the **active session model's context window**: blackhole compacts when the context reaches `floor(contextWindow × compactAfterRatio)`. The threshold is re-derived on every evaluation, so switching models mid-session (`/model`) takes effect on the next check automatically.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number (0, 1] | unset |

Examples on common windows at `0.65`:

```text
128k model → ~83k   200k model → ~130k   1M model → ~650k
```

**How the window is resolved** (see `model.contextWindow` below): per-model config override → Pi's model registry → 128k fallback. If Pi doesn't know your custom-provider model's window, set `contextWindow` on its model entry in this config so the ratio targets the real window.

### `compactReserveTokens` *(context-window-aware threshold, opt-in)*

Alternative derivation that keeps constant headroom: blackhole compacts when only `compactReserveTokens` of window remain — threshold `= contextWindow − compactReserveTokens` (clamped to ≥ 1).

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| positive integer | unset |

```text
200k window − 32k reserve → ~168k    1M window − 32k reserve → ~968k
```

**Precedence & enabling:** when several knobs are set, the effective threshold is decided in this order: explicit `compactAfterTokens` > `compactAfterRatio` (`floor(window × ratio)`) > `compactReserveTokens` (`window − reserve`) > the selected preset curve (default: the built-in `default` preset). An explicit file/env `compactAfterTokens` always wins; the one exception is a file value of exactly `81000`, which is legacy scaffold residue and is dropped so a derived knob or the preset curve governs (see `compactAfterTokens`). Remove all derived keys to fall back to the selected preset curve.

**Settings modal:** the numeric knobs appear under **Compaction** in `/blackhole settings` and are always visible — they use `0` to mean *not set*. Type a real value (e.g. `0.65`, `32768`) to engage the knob; set it back to `0` to disable. The **Compaction threshold preset** select sits alongside them and picks the curve that governs when no numeric key is set. The loader treats a file value of `0` exactly like an absent key.

**Example:**

```jsonc
// Compact at ~65% of whatever model is active (128k → 83k, 200k → 130k, 1M → 650k)
{ "compactAfterRatio": 0.65 }

// Keep at least 32k tokens of headroom free, regardless of window size
{ "compactReserveTokens": 32768 }

// Explicit tokens still win when set deliberately
{ "compactAfterTokens": 180000, "compactAfterRatio": 0.65 }
```

### `compactAfterPreset` *(preset-curve selection knob)*

Names which curve in the effective preset table applies when **no numeric key** is set (`compactAfterTokens`, `compactAfterRatio`, or `compactReserveTokens`). Options = the built-in `default` curve plus any names you added in `compactAfterPresets`; the **Compaction threshold preset** select in `/blackhole settings` lists exactly those names, so the options and runtime resolution cannot disagree.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| string | `"default"` |

An unknown name (typo, or a preset that was dropped for invalid data) warns once and falls back to the built-in `default` curve — resolution always returns a positive threshold, never an error.

Env override: `PI_BLACKHOLE_COMPACT_AFTER_PRESET`.

### `compactAfterPresets` *(preset curve definitions — hand-edited JSON only)*

Defines the window → ratio anchor lists that `compactAfterPreset` selects. **Not a settings-modal field and not a defaults key**: it is hand-edited JSON that config saves carry verbatim, so the modal can never diff, normalize, or clobber it. Built-in definitions ship in code; a same-name entry in this file overrides the built-in curve, and a new name extends the table.

Each preset is a name → ordered array of anchors, `{ "window": <int > 0>, "ratio": <0 < ratio ≤ 1> }`. The ratio at a window is **piecewise-linear interpolation** in window space between the surrounding anchors, and constant outside the anchor range; the effective threshold is `floor(window × ratio)` (minimum 1). A single-anchor preset degenerates to a constant ratio — effectively a global-ratio curve. Anchors are validated at parse time: `window` must be a positive integer and `ratio` in `(0, 1]`; the list is sorted ascending by `window` (a duplicate window keeps the last entry); a preset left with no valid anchors is dropped with a console warning.

Direction of the built-in curve is intentional: the ratio **falls** as the window grows. Small windows fill to ~90% (cheap to send, maximum usable history); huge windows compact early (paid per-token context cost, higher-quality summaries, sharper working set).

**Built-in `default` preset** (curve data is user-tunable — edit the `default` entry below to re-shape it):

| window | ratio | effective threshold (`floor`) | headroom |
| ------ | ----- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| 32,768 | 0.90 | 29,491 | 3,277 |
| 131,072 | 0.80 | 104,857 | 26,215 |
| 262,144 | 0.70 | 183,500 | 78,644 |
| 1,048,576 | 0.40 | 419,430 | 629,146 |

Worked examples: 65,536 → ~0.867 (fires ~56,797); 200,000 → ~0.747 (fires ~149,482, ≈75% full); 1,000,000 → ~0.419 (fires ~418,530); 1,048,576 and above → exactly 0.40 (constant extrapolation); below 32,768 → 0.90 (constant).

**Example:**

```jsonc
{
  "compactAfterPreset": "default", // knob: options = built-in names + names defined below
  "compactAfterPresets": {
    "default": [
      // Same-name override of the built-in curve — anchor values may be tuned
      { "window": 32768, "ratio": 0.9 },
      { "window": 131072, "ratio": 0.8 },
      { "window": 262144, "ratio": 0.7 },
      { "window": 1048576, "ratio": 0.4 }
    ],
    "early-1m": [
      // User-added name (must be selected via the knob) — single anchor = constant 0.6 ratio
      { "window": 131072, "ratio": 0.6 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Migration:** out of the box (no config) the built-in `default` curve governs. A scaffolded/modal-written `"compactAfterTokens": 81000` from before this change is dropped at load (see `compactAfterTokens` above), leaving the preset curve or any configured numeric knob in charge. You only need `compactAfterPresets` when you want to tune a curve or add presets of your own.

## Observational Memory Section

### `memory`

Controls whether observational memory workers run and whether OM content is injected into compaction summaries. **Notably, `memory: false` no longer blocks auto-compaction** — compaction and memory are truly orthogonal.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | OM workers run (observer, reflector, dropper). OM content injected into compaction summaries (default) |
| `false` | No OM workers. No OM content. Compaction still runs normally |

**Examples:**

```jsonc
// Full OM (default)
{ "memory": true }

// Compaction only, no OM workers
{ "memory": false, "compaction": "auto", "compactionEngine": "blackhole" }
```

### `sessionFallback`

When `false`, skip the session-model fallback when all OM model candidates are exhausted. The stage is skipped entirely instead of falling back to the main coding model.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| boolean | `true` |

### `fullFoldAlways`

Treat every compaction as a full-fold boundary so early reflections/drops survive the first compaction in a fresh session.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| boolean | `true` |

### `observeAfterTokens`, `reflectAfterTokens`

Token thresholds that control when the OM pipeline runs. Unchanged from the previous config.

| Key | Default |
|-----|---------|
| `observeAfterTokens` | 15000 |
| `reflectAfterTokens` | 25000 |

### `observationsPoolMaxTokens`

Stored observation-token pressure threshold for full-fold maintenance, plus a hard cap on estimated rendered observation lines in compaction output. IDs, timestamps, relevance labels and newline separators count. High/critical observations are preferred newest-first, then medium/low by relevance and recency. Oversized records are skipped; selected records stay whole and return to source order. Source history is not deleted.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | 20000 |

### `reflectionsPoolMaxTokens`

Hard cap on estimated rendered reflection lines in compaction output. Selects newest whole records that fit, then restores source order. IDs and newline separators count. Non-negative finite integer; `0` disables the cap. Invalid file values use the default. This does not limit worker prompts or raw/view lookups, and omitted source records remain available through `recall`.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| non-negative integer | 8000 |

Both output budgets use the project's chars/4 estimate, not an exact provider tokenizer. Section headings, recall note and footer add tokens outside these line budgets; total trailing memory is not exactly 28,000 tokens. Compact-all retains eligible bounded memory and applies recorded drops.

### `observationsPoolTargetTokens`

Target token budget the dropper aims for after pruning. **Currently a no-op** in the pool algorithm. If unset or `>= observationsPoolMaxTokens`, the loader silently resets it to `floor(observationsPoolMaxTokens / 2)`.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | 10000 |

### `reflectorInputMaxTokens`

Rolling window cap for reflector prompt tokens. The reflector only sees **new** observations plus a summary budget, capped at this value.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | 80000 |

### `dropperInputMaxTokens`

Rolling window cap for dropper prompt tokens.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | 80000 |

### `observerChunkMaxTokens`

Max source-entry tokens sent to the observer per chunk.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | 40000 |

### `observerPreambleMaxTokens`

Max preamble tokens per section (`CURRENT REFLECTIONS` / `CURRENT OBSERVATIONS`) in the observer prompt. Default `0` means auto-compute from `observerChunkMaxTokens` (30%). Applied in both auto/manual compaction modes so the observer prompt does not grow without bound as the session accumulates memory: observations are relevance-ranked, reflections newest-first. The pre-flight context guard prices the full prompt (chunk + rendered preamble + system prompt), so an oversized prompt skips the model cleanly instead of failing every attempt with a provider 400.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | 0 |

### `dropperPressureThreshold`

Fraction of `observationsPoolMaxTokens` at which the dropper runs without new data. The pool must also clear `dropperPoolFullnessThreshold`; `1.0` disables pressure.

| Type | Default | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| number | 0.70 | (0, 1] |

### `dropperPoolFullnessThreshold`

Minimum observation-pool fullness (fraction of `observationsPoolMaxTokens`) before the dropper may run. Prevents the dropper from churning a nearly empty pool. Once the pool passes this threshold, the dropper runs when enough new transcript accumulates (`reflectAfterTokens`) with new observations/reflections. Lower it (e.g. `0.05`) to have the dropper prune more eagerly on lean pools.

| Type | Default | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| number | 0.10 | (0, 1] |

- **0.70** (default): pressure-driven dropper runs when the observation pool reaches 70% of `observationsPoolMaxTokens`
- **Higher** (e.g. 0.90): waits until the observation pool is fuller before pressure-driven pruning
- **Lower** (e.g. 0.50): starts pressure-driven pruning at lower observation-pool fullness
- **1.0**: disable pressure-driven dropper entirely — dropper only runs when new observation/reflection data exists AND pool fullness reaches `dropperPoolFullnessThreshold` (10% by default)

### `agentMaxTurns`

Shared turn cap for background memory agents. It is passed as `maxTurns` to `runObserver`, `runReflector`, and `runDropper` agent loops, capping retry/reasoning iterations within a single stage execution.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| number | 16 |

### `cacheRetention`

Provider-neutral prompt-cache retention preference forwarded to the observer, reflector, and dropper worker streams. Unset defers to pi's effective setting (its provider default is `short`). Adapters that do not support a value ignore it, so `long` is opt-in rather than our default.

- **unset** — inherit pi's effective setting (its provider default is `short`).
- **`none`** — no prompt caching where the adapter supports it.
- **`short`** — short-lived retention, pi's provider default.
- **`long`** — extended retention where supported.

Accepted via plain config, `/blackhole settings`, or `PI_BLACKHOLE_CACHE_RETENTION`; values are case-insensitive on every path, so `"LONG"` resolves to `long`. The settings modal shows an explicit `unset` option so an untouched field never pins a value, and switching back to `unset` removes a stored value from the file; invalid file or env values are dropped at load and the previous value stays. The setting only affects memory workers, never foreground Pi chat requests.

| Type | Default | Values |
|------|---------|--------|
| string | unset | `none` \| `short` \| `long` |

### `providerIdleTimeoutMs`

Body-idle timeout for background provider streams (observer/reflector/dropper worker HTTP requests). Higher values let background memory jobs tolerate longer silent provider intervals without forcing interactive Pi requests to wait equally long. Applied by wrapping the provider `fetch` with an undici dispatcher that injects `bodyTimeout`.

- **unset** — inherit pi's global provider timeout (no wrapper applied).
- **`0`** — explicitly disabled (no wrapper applied).
- **`> 0`** — allow at most this many milliseconds between response-body chunks.

This is not a hard request deadline: waiting for response headers, streamed heartbeat bytes, and later agent-loop turns can keep a worker alive longer. Use `workerAttemptTimeoutMs` when fallback must happen by a wall-clock deadline.

Accepted via plain config or `PI_BLACKHOLE_PROVIDER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`. Negative values are rejected. WebSocket transports are not affected.

| Type | Default | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| number | unset | `0` or positive integer |

### `workerAttemptTimeoutMs`

Hard elapsed deadline for one worker/model attempt. It covers the complete observer, reflector, or dropper agent loop for the selected model: response headers, streamed bodies and heartbeats, tool turns, and final confirmation. When the deadline expires, Blackhole aborts that attempt. If the model is a configured candidate, Blackhole records its cooldown and immediately resolves the next fallback, which gets a fresh deadline. The final session-model fallback behaves differently: it is attempted once per stage, and a timeout there records no cooldown and ends the stage's model search instead of retrying the same session model up to ten times.

- **unset** or **`0`** — disabled.
- **`> 0`** — abort one model attempt after this many milliseconds.

Accepted via plain config, `/blackhole settings`, or `PI_BLACKHOLE_WORKER_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_MS`. Settings-modal saves persist the key correctly at global, project, and session scope. Direct config and env values must not exceed 2,147,483,647 ms (Node's maximum timer delay); larger values are rejected. The settings UI caps edits at 3,600,000 ms. It only affects Blackhole workers, never foreground Pi chat requests.

| Type | Default | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| number | unset | `0` or positive integer |

## Model Configuration

Model overrides are **first-class config keys**, not "unknown keys". They are fully parsed and validated by `loadUnifiedConfig()` and are **only editable via direct file edit** (the `/blackhole configure` overlay preserves them but does not surface them).

### Primary models

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `model` | Base model override for all memory workers. Tried after stage-specific models and fallbacks. |
| `observerModel` | Primary observer model (most frequent worker). |
| `reflectorModel` | Primary reflector model (synthesizes durable facts). |
| `dropperModel` | Primary dropper model (prunes observations). |

### Fallback arrays

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `observerFallbackModels` | Ordered fallback array for observer, tried after `observerModel`. |
| `reflectorFallbackModels` | Ordered fallback array for reflector, tried after `reflectorModel`. |
| `dropperFallbackModels` | Ordered fallback array for dropper, tried after `dropperModel`. |

### `OmModelConfig` schema

Each model config supports the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | Provider name (required). |
| `id` | string | Model ID (required). |
| `thinking` | enum | Thinking level: `"off"`, `"minimal"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"xhigh"`, `"max"`. Defaults to `"low"` when unset. |
| `cooldownHours` | number | Cooldown duration in hours after a cooldown-worthy error — transient (429/5xx/timeout) or deterministic 4xx (missing provider-required headers, bad credentials, unknown model). Defaults to `1` when omitted. Set to `0` to disable persistent cooldown. |
| `contextWindow` | number | Override for the model's context window. Inherits from Pi's model registry when unset. |

**Example:**

```jsonc
{
  "observerModel": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "id": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "thinking": "low",
    "cooldownHours": 2,
    "contextWindow": 200000
  },
  "observerFallbackModels": [
    { "provider": "openai", "id": "gpt-4o", "thinking": "minimal" }
  ]
}
```

## UI Section

### `statusBar`

Show the footer status bar: three token gauges — O (transcript since last observer run), P (observation pool fill), X (context since last compaction) — plus worker spinners and `✓ +N` completion events. O and P render only while [`memory`](#memory) is `true`: with observational memory disabled the pipeline hard-returns before any observer runs, so a filling gauge would imply a note-taking pass that is never due. The gauges return on the next render after `/blackhole om-on` re-enables memory.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| boolean | `true` |

### `showWorkerNotifications`

Routine observer, reflector, and dropper progress toasts — `observer running on ~N-token chunk`, `N observations recorded`, `reflector running`, `dropper running`, and the info-level `no observations` notice. Set to `false` for quiet sessions.

Warnings and errors are unaffected: model fallback/unavailability, context-window skips, no-output warnings, worker failures, compaction notifications, and explicit `/blackhole*` command output all stay visible.

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| boolean | `true` |

## Debug Section

### `debug` / `debugLog`

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `debug` | boolean | false | Writes detailed debug snapshots to `/tmp/pi-blackhole-debug.json` |
| `debugLog` | boolean | false | Writes structured JSONL debug logs to the agent directory |

## Deprecated Keys

These keys are still accepted for backward compatibility but are silently migrated to the new surface on load. They are removed from the in-memory config object and not written back by the overlay.

| Key | Replacement |
|-----|-------------|
| `overrideDefaultCompaction` | `compactionEngine` + `tailBehavior` |
| `noAutoCompact` | `compaction: "manual"` |
| `passive` | `compaction: "off"` + `memory: false` |

## Environment Variable Overrides

Environment variables override config file values **at load time** and apply to both the runtime and the modal. Invalid values fall back to the configured (or default) value.

Boolean parsing accepts `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` (and `0`, `false`, `no`, `off`).

| `PI_BLACKHOLE_MID_RUN_COMPACTION` | `midRunCompaction` (`resume` \| `pause` \| `off`) | `PI_BLACKHOLE_MID_RUN_COMPACTION=resume` |
| `PI_BLACKHOLE_SHOW_PRE_COMPACTION_MESSAGE` | `showPreCompactionMessage` (`true` \| `false`) | `PI_BLACKHOLE_SHOW_PRE_COMPACTION_MESSAGE=off` |
| `PI_BLACKHOLE_COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MODE` | `compactionSummaryMode` (`default` \| `append`) | `PI_BLACKHOLE_COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MODE=append` |

## Viewing & Editing

- **Config file**: `~/.pi/agent/pi-blackhole/pi-blackhole-config.json`
- **TUI overlay**: `/blackhole settings` (alias: `/blackhole configure`) — opens an interactive overlay with ↑↓ navigation, Enter to toggle, Ctrl+S to save
- **CLI subcommands**: `/blackhole om-off` / `/blackhole om-on` — toggle memory without editing the file

### `compactionSummaryMode`

Controls how auto-compaction summaries are stored and presented to the model. Only applies when `compaction: "auto"` and `compactionEngine: "blackhole"`. Explicit `/blackhole` triggers independent of this mode and always folds the chain into a clean segment.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"default"` | Each auto-compaction replaces the previous summary with a fresh one (rewrite — existing behavior, default). |
| `"append"` | Each auto-compaction appends one immutable provider-visible segment (`S1 \| S2 \| …`). The model sees all prior compaction segments alongside the current conversation. Every stored summary remains a complete fallback. |

**In `append` mode:**
- Auto-compactions append a new segment to the chain; earlier segments stay visible to the model.
- Explicit `/blackhole` rebases the active chain into one clean segment and starts a new chain.
- Legacy v1 summaries (from before this feature) enter through one marked rebase.
- At an existing compaction, ordinary rebase requires pressure **and** useful saving. Pressure means rendered append chain (including incoming segment and host wrappers) exceeds `floor(W / 8)`, or estimated full context exceeds `floor(W / 2)`. Saving must reach `max(1, min(24000, floor(24000 * W / 272000)))`. At a 272k window: 34k chain pressure, 136k context pressure, 24k minimum saving.
- Both candidates contain the same current memory and kept tail. Full totals use a compatible trusted usage baseline minus reconstructed visible baseline plus reconstructed candidate content. Missing or inconsistent evidence leaves totals **unknown**, with chain-only policy still available. Without a supplied finite positive window, use 34k/24k chain policy and no invented capacity threshold.
- Explicit `/blackhole` forces rebase after normal guards. `/compact` does not. Overflow recovery, or known append total above `W - reserveTokens`, chooses the smaller candidate without a 24k minimum. Estimates do not prove overflow recovery; Pi retains retry/error control.
- This governor never requests compaction. Upstream threshold presets and explicit user cadence (including 168,000) are unchanged. No extra model call, price model, or timer.
- A new `context` hook projects segments before each model call and **fails closed to the fallback** on any malformed state.
- Falls back to rewrite surgery once per session when append mode encounters unsupported state.

**Example:**

```jsonc
// Default: each compaction rewrites the summary (existing behavior)
{ "compactionSummaryMode": "default" }

// Append: freeze auto-compaction segments for the model
{ "compactionSummaryMode": "append" }
```

See [`docs/APPEND_COMPACTION.md`](docs/APPEND_COMPACTION.md) for the fallback, branch, observational-memory, and cache-measurement rules.
